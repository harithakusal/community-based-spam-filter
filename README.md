# community-based-spam-filter
This project is a community-powered solution to spam filtering. It consists of a spam filtering engine that will further enhance the accuracy of spam detection by using the input of user ratings. Often spam filters miss some of the spam messages and deliver them to inbox. In order to catch those spam messages, the system needs to increase the sensitivity of algorithms running inside the spam filters. The spam filter will detect, and filter emails using spam filtering techniques and as a new technique, the system will request a rating from users to rate received spam emails missed by the spam filter. Users should consider the content of the email and decide If they are spam or not spam according to their own point of view. This technique will also help to personalize spam according to the user requirement. A spam email for someone may not be spam for another person. Therefore, individual feedback can also be used to meet individual needs while filtering messages.
